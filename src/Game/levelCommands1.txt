Raise the Main Sails
Incoming Ship! Fire all the Cannons
The ship is gone. Jump Ship!
Make those scurvy dogs walk the plank
Incoming Wave! Hard te' Starboard
There's a whale! Hard te' Port!
Swab the Poop Deck ye scurvy dogs.
Prepare to attack! Hoist the Jolly Roger!
Aye Mateys. Drink the Rum!
Get those cutlasses clean!
Me parrot is hungry, feed me parrot!
Get the gun powder on deck!
Yer Swords be dull, Sharpen them!
They're after yer Booty, but it in a place they won't find it!
Yer being charged by an enemy pirate, put a musketball in his face!
Yer hull be damaged, go under the deck and fix it!
Spirits be low, sing a shanty to cheer up yer crew!
Yer crew be hungry, give em some Sea Biscuits!
Pull out yer spyglass and check for hostile ships!
Check how many paces it be to X!
Ye need to speed up, raise yer anchor!
Cannonballs be running low, get some more!
Yer crew has scurvy, feed them some citrus to cure them!
Yer out of food, get some more!
Get yerself a bird's eye view, climb into the crow's nest!
A few of your crew attempted mutiny, kill them!
Time to grab the enemy's booty, board their ship!
Trick the British Navy, fly their colors!
Its time to lay low, take refuge in the cove!
It be time to record the recent events on your ship!
