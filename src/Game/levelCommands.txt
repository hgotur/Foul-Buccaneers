Raise the Main Sails
Incoming Ship! Fire all the Cannons
The ship is gone. Jump Ship!
Make those scurvy dogs walk the plank
Incoming Wave! Hard te' Starboard
There's a whale! Hard te' Port!
Swab the Poop Deck ye scurvy dogs.
Prepare to attack! Hoist the Jolly Roger!
Aye Mateys. Drink the Rum!
Get those cutlasses clean!
Me parrot is hungry, feed me parrot!
Get the gun powder on deck!
Yer Swords be dull, sharpen yer swords!
They're after yer Booty, hide yer Booty!
Fire yer pistol at the charging enemy pirate!
Yer hull be damaged, go patch yer hull!
Spirits be low, sing a pirate song to cheer up yer crew!
Yer crew be hungry, pass out provisions to them!
Pull out yer spyglass and check the horizon for hostile ships!
Check yer Map to see how many paces it be to X!
Ye need to speed up, raise yer anchor!
Cannonballs be running low, restock yer cannonballs!
You have scurvy, eat some oranges to cure yerself!
Yer out of food, restock yer provisions!
Get yerself a bird's eye view, climb into the crow's nest!
A few of your crew attempted mutiny, kill the dissenters!
Time to grab the enemy's booty, board their ship!
Trick the British Navy, fly the Union Jack!
Its time to lay low, hide in the cove!
Write in yer Captain's Log about the recent happens on the ship!
